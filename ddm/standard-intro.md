# Dundee Data Meetup

## Opening and Fire Safety

- Good evening, folks, and welcome to Dundee Data Meetup, here in the amazing DC Thomson building and in particular, the Vista Room.
- Thank you for coming along to our `[Month]` edition of the meetup!
- My name is `[Name]`, and Iâ€™m your host for tonight.
  - `[Intro Blurb]`
- We need to do some quick housekeeping:
  - There is no planned fire drill
  - In the event of a fire, the fire alarm will sound.
  - Please make your way calmly to the nearest emergency exit (point out). The assembly point is outside the building.

## Intro to meetup

- We started the meetup to fill the hole of the lack of a similar event in the Dundee and Tayside area.
- We have an event on the Last Tuesday of every month
- We are not just for experts but for **everyone** who has an interest in data, big or small!
- We hope that it allows people to share knowledge, successes, promote ideas, foster collaboration and innovation as well as promote good practice.
- As a reminder, this event is built by the community, so we welcome your input!
  - If you know anyone who can speak or if you want to hear about a particular topic, please let us know!
